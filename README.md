# Pro-social-behavior and climate change
This repository provides the data and analysis files to reproduce the results of the  paper "Pro-social behavior and Climate Change". Does exposure to fast and slow-onset climate hazards affect prosociality towards others? Economic theory and evidence from students suggests that such behaviors would decline in case of a looming displacement threat. We test these predictions using behavioral tasks to measure prosociality and randomize information to make climate hazards salient for one group.  We recruit people who experienced a typhoon in the Philippines, live on low-lying atolls in Solomon Islands or in delta-regions in Bangladesh and Vietnam. Our results show that both fast and slow-onset natural disasters increase pro-social behavior without harming the out-group. Peoples’ response to the displacement threat is geared towards collective adaptation in-situ with the potential for uncontrolled displacement in the future without adequate polices in place.

## Abstract
We study the impact of fast and slow-onset natural hazards on pro-social behaviors. People’s willingness to engage in pro-social behaviors, may ultimately inform about the potential for collective action, resource use, migration, or even conflicts. We examine this relationship using incentivized behavioral tasks, conducted with people who experienced typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines (n=336), or come from sea-level hotspots (n=863) in the Asia-Pacific region. The participants are randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) either learning about potential impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) using short videos, or rethinking Typhoon Haiyan, and (2) a neutral control condition. Our results show that participants in the treatment condition behave more pro-socially towards fellow villagers, without harming the out-group. Negative emotions dampen this effect for the more affected people. Our results emphasize the reliance on habitual behavior, geared towards the importance of well-functioning social networks, for dealing with hardship and uncertainty.  

## Data and analysis files
The code in this repository can be used to reproduce the figures and regression analysis in Stata (some packages need to be installed via SSC). In addition, we provide the data in excel-format that can be used in other statistic programs
- "code-prosocial_behavior&CC.do" includes the Stata code
- "Haiyan_data.dta/xlsx" includes the data from the Philippines study
- "SLR_pooled_data.dta/xlsx" includes the data from the pooled SLR samples (Solomon Islands, Bangladesh, Vietnam)
- "trust_game_data.dta/xlsx" includes the data from the repeated trust game (Solomon Islands only)
