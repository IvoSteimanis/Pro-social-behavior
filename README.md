# Pro-social behavior in response to slow- and fast-onset hazards
This repository provides the information videos used in the treatments, as well as the data and analysis files to reproduce the results of the  paper "Pro-social behavior in response to slow- and fast-onset hazards". Does exposure to fast and slow-onset climate hazards affect prosociality towards others? Economic theory and evidence from students suggests that such behaviors would decline in case of a looming displacement threat. We test these predictions using behavioral tasks to measure prosociality and randomize information to make climate hazards salient for one group.  We recruit people who experienced a typhoon in the Philippines, live on low-lying atolls in Solomon Islands or in delta-regions in Bangladesh and Vietnam. Our results show that both fast and slow-onset natural disasters increase pro-social behavior without harming the out-group. Peoples’ response to the displacement threat is geared towards collective actions to adapt in-situ.

## Abstract
People’s willingness to engage in pro-social behaviors may ultimately inform about how resilient societies are towards upcoming climate extremes. We study the impact of fast and slow-onset natural hazards on pro-social behaviors using incentivized behavioral tasks, conducted with people who experienced typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines (n=337) or come from sea-level rise hotspots (n=851) in the Asia-Pacific region. We experimentally manipulate the salience of these hazards by randomly assigning participants to a neutral control condition or one of two treatment conditions: (1) either learning about potential impacts of sea-level rise (SLR) using short videos, or (2) rethinking Typhoon Haiyan. We find that increased salience of hazards leads to more pro-social behaviors towards fellow villagers, without harming the out-group. Our results show that people are motivated to act in solidarity with people who lived through the same experience. 

## Treatments: Information videos
In order to channel participant’s thoughts on potential consequences caused by SLR we used three-minute-long videos. These videos included testimonials of people that are in a comparable situation and visualize the impacts of SLR (land erosion, floods, stronger high tides; saltwater intrusion, loss of harvest). Between samples, we hold the style and content of the videos constant and vary to what degree migration to adapt is shown. In Vietnam, we additionally introduced two hypothetical scenarios at the end of the video to experimentally vary the relocation belief – either individual relocation or community resettlement.  The video treatment was randomly assigned at the session level in the experimental workshops in Solomon Islands, and at the individual level in the survey experiments. In Solomon Islands, we decided against showing a neutral video in the control sessions. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility of any video effects per se driving the results in Solomon Islands.
